# TODO

- Add a hero section above the menu. e.g. 

```
the first section you see when you open a webpage, the part above the fold
you'll often have a big image and a heading that is a value proposition and a call to action button
so i would have a big picture of your wife probably or her helping a preggo lady
then her name and a value prop so i know instantly, what's in it for me? Why would i choose her?
and then a button linked to her booking page on doctolib, assuming she uses that. people can scroll down more to see the services or use the menu
```
